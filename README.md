# Streaming Coresets for Symmetric Tensor Factorization

This project is used to perform experiments done in our paper "Streaming Coresets for Symmetric Tensor Factorization" by Rachit Chhaya, Jayesh Choudhari, Anirban Dasgupta and Supratim Shit. We run tensor factorization to do single topic modeling. We have used few tensor functions from http://www.tensorlab.net. Once you have all the tensorlab package you can run main.m. We have provided a small dataset from 20newsgroup in the project.
